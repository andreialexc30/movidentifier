<h1>Movidentifier</h1>
<hr />
<p>Movidentifier is a web application with the primary function of allowing users to search up the movies they want, along with their specific details. The application allows the user to save a movie into a 'watch later' type list, which can later be organised into a watched or not watched format while also having the option of removing movies. I have also implemented a shopping cart for renting movies, but it's mostly just for showcase as this is not the main functionality of the app. The Movidentifier web app serves as a CRUD(Create-Read-Update-Delete) bigger application of mine that showcases my knowledge of web development and the VueJS framework</p>
